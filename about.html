              </h2>
              <p> My Better Candle started as small, family run manufacturer based in the heart of San Francisco (CA). The little shop developed steadily into the popular, multi awarded, customised candle shop which it is today.
  We are so proud to carry on with the mission that our great great grandparents started, and honoured to sell to retail and trade customers throughout the United States, Europe and beyond. It's in our heart to give you the products and service that you deserve and we thank each and every one of you to be so loyal and keep supporting us.
  Our very first shop is still open and it's the main attraction for our customers, you can experience a tour where once, everything was made, packed and managed. On our walls there are pictures of how the shop used to be, displays of our first customers and sales, and obviously some of the equipment that has been used is available for you to take a look at.</p>

      <span class="section-heading-lower"> How We Do It</span>
    </h2>
    <p>Candles bring so many good things – relaxation, invigoration, the recall of memory that often comes with scent – but many brands also come with so-called “nasties”: chemical fragrances (which some find induce headaches) and scent boosters, paraffin wax (made from petroleum), which gives off carcinogens when burned, and wicks with a core of metal.
    Fortunately for candle lovers, there are alternatives. All of our products are made using natural fragrance, such as essential oils, and have pure cotton and/or paper wicks.
    Our candles are consciously made through and through: they are crafted from a blend of natural wax, hand-poured into our beautiful containers from recycled glass and the boxes we use are 100 per cent recyclable.</p>
